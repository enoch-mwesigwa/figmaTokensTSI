# Figma Tokens for TSI Website

This repository contains the design tokens for tsi-mi.com. These tokens include definitions for colors, typography, spacing, border radius, and more, all maintained in JSON format. They are generated and managed using [Tokens Studio for Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/tokens-studio-for-figma) to ensure consistency across our design and development workflows.

## Purpose

Our design tokens serve as a single source of truth for our visual language. By using these tokens, designers and developers can ensure a cohesive look and feel across our website. They make it easy to update the design system in Figma, with changes automatically propagating to the codebase.

## Contents

- **dimension:** A modular scale for sizing.
- **spacing:** Consistent spacing values based on our dimension scale.
- **borderRadius:** Tokens for border radii across UI components.
- **colors:** Our complete color palette including brand colors, neutrals, and standard scales.
- **opacity:** Predefined opacity levels.
